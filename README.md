# Roll The Dice!

Roll The Dice! is a turn-based Multiplayer game in which the players must roll a dice to accumulate as many points as possible.


## How to Play (Rules)


In order to win, a player needs to accumulate 100 points before his opponent.
In each round, the player whose turn it is must roll a dice, and whatever number
it lands on, is the amount of points that the player will start accumulating
for the round. However, if the dice lands on 1, the player will lose the round, and
it's the next player's turn.

If it doesn't, the player has two options:

- Take the points home, and let their opponent attempt to accumulate points
- Roll the dice again, and try to accumulate more points, risking all the points they've earned for the current round

#### Note:

There is no limit to how many times a player can roll the dice before the round ends.
